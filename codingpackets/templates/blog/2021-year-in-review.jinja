<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>
  2021, another year, another year of the pandemic. 
  I had lots of plans for 2021 and life decided to 
  get in the way of most of them. 
</p>
<p>
  At the start of the year I set
  my yearly goals outlined in {{ link::i(path="/blog/2021-goals", description="this") }} post.
  Someone really close to me was diagnosed with Cancer in 
  January and helping them through that consumed 
  most of my bandwidth for any extra-carricular 
  activities.
</p>
<p>
  Seriously, cancer sucks ass. My near and 
  dear has thankfully come out the other side after 
  surgery, chemo and radiation treatment and is 
  on the long road back to health.
</p>

<h3 id="2021-goals">2021 Goals</h3>
<h4>Health and Fitness</h4>
<p>
  My health and fitness took a bit of a hit in 2021. 
</p>
<p>
  The half iron-man was cancelled due to Covid. 
  I managed to ride my bike, alot less than I 
  wanted to. I came nowhere near my strength
  building goals. On top of that, I put on about 
  10kgs! FARK!!!!
</p>
<p>
  I did start an atomic workout routine in December 
  which I will outline more in me 2022 goals post 
  comming up shortly.
</p>

<h4>Family</h4>
<p>
  Worklife got in the way of family life a bit this 
  year. I started a new job in January, which seemed 
  to consume alot of family time. Between learning 
  new technologies and after hours work, it was really 
  draining for all by the end of the year. 
</p>

<h4>Certifications</h4>
<p>
  On the certification front, I did not acheive any of my 
  goals, work was just too busy and there was too much more 
  important stuff to attend to. The only cert I managed to 
  complete was the Citrix SD-WAN cert. Something, I hope I 
  never have to use in my life.  
</p>

<h4>Books</h4>
<p>
  I read or listended to 25 books this year, about a book 
  every 2 weeks on average.
</p>

<h4>Automation</h4>
<p>
  Nothing came of the network automation project I was working 
  on. Sadly, after January, time for side projects was in short 
  supply.
</p>

<h4>Mansformation</h4>
<p>
  Am I a man yet? Check 
  {{ link::i(path="/blog/growing-a-beard", description="here") }}
  to find out. Spoiler alert. NOOP! 
</p>

<h4>Programming Languages</h4>
<p>
  I ended up having a bit of a worldwind tour of programming 
  languages this year. I started out by dabbling in Elixir, 
  Spend a fair amount of time in the first half of the year 
  learning Go. Spent a few months learning Crystal and in the 
  last 2 weeks of 2021, started learning Rust.
</p>
<p>
  Crystal, is an awesome language, if it had a better Windows story 
  I would do all my dev in Crystal. 
</p>
<p>
  I must say, I am really enjoying Rust so far, over the next 
  couple of months, I will find out if I will stick with it.
</p>

<h4>New Job</h4>
<p>
  I stared a new job in November. It's more of a security focused 
  role with a smattering of automation. 
</p>

<h4>Goodbye Networking</h4>
<p>
  After about ~15 years in networking I am pivoting 
  away from network focused roles. I 
  like networking, I just don't love it anymore. I find the 
  newer technologies pretty boring. I have also grown really 
  frustrated at how slow the vendors are moving on the automation 
  front. It's getting better, maybe in another 10 years it 
  will have improved enough for me to be interested again.
</p>
<p>
  I have also grown tired of the long afterhours and weekend work 
  that is required for the role. I lost way to much time 
  with my family this year and my health was affected by the 
  odd hours. I'm done with oddball hours. If I ever take a 
  networking role again, I will be doing all my changes in the 
  middle of the day. 
</p>
<p>
  I have decided to move more into the security/cloud space 
  with a focus on automation/design and will be focusing 
  my efforts in those areas in future.
</p>

<h3 id="outro">Outro</h3>
<p>
  2021 seemed to fly-by there was so much going on in my life. 
  It kind of feels like I was just surviving at times and not 
  alot of living happened. Let's hope for a better year in 2022.
  Stay safe all!
</p>
