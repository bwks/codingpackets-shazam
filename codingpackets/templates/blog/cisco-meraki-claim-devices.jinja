  Tune in for a fun fact about claiming Meraki devices 
  in the Meraki portal.
</p>

<h3 id="how-to-claim-devices">How To Claim Devices</h3>
<p>
  There are two ways to "claim" Meraki devices in the 
  Meraki portal.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>via serial number</li>
  <li>via order number</li>
</ul>

{{ text::important_block(text="
  If you claim a device from an order via the serial 
  number, you will no longer be able to claim any of 
  the other devices via the order number. WTF!!!!
")
}}

<p>
  I found this out on a project where a couple of AP's 
  were mounted on a 30ft high ceiling before I got there 
  and no one recorded the serials. The scissor lift that 
  was used to put them there had also left for good ðŸ˜¥
  When I tried to claim them via the order number the 
  computer said NNNNNNOOOOOOOO!
</p>

<p>
  If you find yourself in this situation you can ask your 
  reseller/distributer for the serial numbers for your order. 
  I raised a case with Meraki support to get the serial numbers 
  and they helpfully informed me "Only the contacts that placed 
  the order can get access to the serial numbers for the order.".
</p>

<p>
  Well SSSSHHHHHHEEEEEETTTTTTT
</p>

{{ text::note_block(text="
    If all your devices are on the same order, claim them 
    via the order number $1 claiming any via the serial number."
    | replace(from="$1", to=text::emphasize(text="BEFORE"))
    )
}}

  Thats it for now. Check back later for more funky Meraki 
  fun times.
