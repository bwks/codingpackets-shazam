    Overview
  </h3>
  <p>
    Juniper protocol-independent routing covers IP routing components
    such as static routes and the various route tables within Junos
    that are not particular to any dynamic routing protocol.
  </p>
  <h3 id="routing-table">
    Routing Table
  </h3>
  <p>
    The RE holds a copy of all routes from all
    protocols in its routing table. The
    {{ text::emphasize(text="best") }}
 routes based
    on the {{ text::emphasize(text="protocol preference") }}

    are declared {{ text::emphasize(text="active") }}
 and
    placed in the forwarding table.
    The forwarding table is shared with the PFE.
  </p>
  <h3 id="forwarding-table">
    Forwarding Table
  </h3>
  <p>
    The PFE stores a local copy of the forwarding table
    received from the RE containing the
    {{ text::emphasize(text="best") }}
 routes to each
    destination.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both the layer 2 and layer 3 forwarding tables are received
    from the RE.
  </p>
  <h3 id="configured-routes">
    Configured Routes
  </h3>
  <p>
    Within Junos there are three types of administrator
    configurable routes.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Static Routes</li>
    <li>Aggregated Routes</li>
    <li>Generated Routes</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="static-routes">Static Routes</h3>
  <p>
    A static route defines a destination prefix and the
    next-hop (IP or label) to reach the destination.
  </p>

  {{ text::important_block(text='
    For a static route to be present in the routing table the $1'
    )
    | replace(from="$1", to=text::emphasize(text="next-hop must be valid."))  
   }}

  <h3 id="next-hop">
    Next-Hop
  </h3>
  <p>
    For a route to be present in the routing table, the route must
    have a valid next-hop. For a next-hop to be valid the router
    must be able to forward traffic to the next-hop address.
  </p>

  <h4>Next-Hop Options</h4>
  <p>
    There are a number of next-hop options which can be applied to
    protocol-independent routes outlined in the table below.
  </p>

{{ table::default(
  header=["Next-Hop Option", "Description", "Application"],
  rows=[
      "<b>Directly Connected IP Address</b> | An adjacent IP address on a physically connected subnet. | Static",
      "<b>Remote IP Address</b> | A non-adjacent IP address. A recursive looking will be performed to determine the interface leading towards the IP address. | Static",
      "<b>reject</b> | Assigns the route as a Null route and lookup matching the route are dropped. If packets are dropped due to a rejected route the router will send an ICMP 'Destination Host Unreachable' back to the source. | Static <br>Aggregate",
      "<b>discard</b> | Same as reject routes except no ICMP messages are sent and the routes are silently dropped. | Static <br> Aggregate",
      "<b>Qualified Next-Hop</b> | Allows the assignment of multiple next-hop addresses for a prefix. Used with a preference value and equivalent to a floating static routes. | Static",
      "<b>Label Switched Path (LSP)</b> | Enables the assignment of and MPLS label as a next-hop. Matching route lookups are forwarded with a label value instead of an IP address. | Static",
  ],
) }}


  <h3 id="route-attributes">
    Route Attributes
  </h3>
  <p>
    As well as next-hop options, attributes can also be assigned to
    all locally configured routes. The various attributes are defined
    in the table below.
  </p>

{{ table::default(
  header=["Attribute", "Description"],
  rows=[
    "<b>active</b> | Default attribute. Removes a route from the routing table if the next-hop become unavailable.",
    "<b>passive</b> | Opposite of active, allows a route to stay in the routing table if the next-hop become unavailable.",
    "<b>install</b> | Default attribute. Installs a usable static route into the PFE.",
    "<b>no-install</b> | Opposite of the install attribute. A usable static route is not installed into the PFE.",
    "<b>as-path</b> | Manual assignment of BGP AS path attributes to the route.",
    "<b>community</b> | Manual assignment of BGP communities to the route.",
    "<b>metric</b> | Use the determine route preference when multiple next-hops to the same destination exist.",
    "<b>readvertise</b> | Default attribute. Allows a route to be exported from the routing table and redistributed into another routing protocol.",
    "<b>no-readvertise</b> | Opposite of advertise. Prevents the route from being exported from the routing table and redistributed into another routing protocol.",
    "<b>preference</b> | Alters the default preference value of a route.",
    "<b>no-retain</b> | Default attribute. Route is removed from the forwarding table if the routing process is shutdown.",
    "<b>retain</b> | Opposite of retain. Route will remain in the forwarding table if the routing process is shutdown.",
  ],
) }}




  <h3 id="aggregate-routes">
    Aggregate Routes
  </h3>
  <p>
    Aggregate routes are used to announce a collection of multiple
    smaller routes summarized into a single route announcement.
  </p>
  <h4>Contributing Routes</h4>
  <p>
    For an aggregate route to be present in the routing table at
    least one of its more specific routes must be present in the
    routing table. Thus the more specific routes are known as
    contributing routes.
  </p>
  <h4>Primary Contributing Route</h4>
  <p>
    The route with the numerically smallest prefix is selected as
    the primary contributing route. An administrator can influence
    the selection using routing policy.
  </p>

  <h3 id="generated-routes">
    Generated Routes
  </h3>
  <p>
    Generated routes are identical to an aggregate route except
    that a generated route has an IP address defined for its
    next-hop and the ability to apply the
    {{ text::emphasize(text="discard") }}
 option.
  </p>
  <p>
    Contributing routes must have an IP address for a next-hop
    or come from a connected P2P interface. Additionally, routes
    with a next-hop options of either
    {{ text::emphasize(text="discard") }}
 or
    {{ text::emphasize(text="reject") }}
 cannot contribute.
  </p>

  <h3 id="martian-routes">
    Martian Routes
  </h3>
  <p>
    Martian routes are prefixes that should never be publicly
    routed on the internet. Prefixes that fall into the
    category of a martian route will not be placed in the
    routing table. Additionally, martian routes received via
    routing protocols will be ignored.
  </p>
  {{ text::note_block(text='
    <p>
      RFC 1918 IP block are excluded from the martian routes
      filtering policy.
  ') }}

  <h3 id="routing-tables">
    Routing Tables
  </h3>
  <p>
    Junos includes a number of different routing tables
    for various protocols as outlined in the table below.
  </p>

{{ table::default(
  header=["Table", "Description"],
  rows=[
      "<b>inet.0</b> | IPv4 unicast routes.",
      "<b>inet.1</b> | IPv4 multicast forwarding cache.",
      "<b>inet.2</b> | IPv4 unicast routes for the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check.",
      "<b>inet.3</b> | MPLS LSP egress IP addresses",
      "<b>inet.4</b> | Information learned using the multicast source discovery protocol (MSDP).",
      "<b>inet6.0</b> | IPv6 unicast routes.",
      "<b>inet6.1</b> | IPv6 multicast forwarding cache.",
      "<b>mpls.0</b> | Actually a switching table storing MPLS label values.",
      "<b>bgp.l3vpn.0</b> | Routing information for BGP L3VPNs.",
      "<b>bgp.l2vpn.0</b> | Routing information for BGP L2VPNs.",
  ],
) }}




  <h3 id="routing-preference">
    Routing Preference
  </h3>
  <p>
    When a prefix is learned by more than one protocol
    Junos selects the most believable route based on the
    preference. The lower the preference the more believable
    the route. The default preferences are listed in the
    table below.
  </p>

{{ table::default(
  header=["Source", "Preference"],
  rows=[
      "<b>Direct</b> | 0",
      "<b>Local</b> | 0",
      "<b>Static</b> | 5",
      "<b>RSVP</b> | 7",
      "<b>LDP</b> | 9",
      "<b>OSPF Internal</b> | 10",
      "<b>IS-IS Level 1 Internal</b> | 15",
      "<b>IS-IS Level 2 Internal</b> | 18",
      "<b>RIP / RIPNG</b> | 100",
      "<b>PIM</b> | 105",
      "<b>Aggregate / Generated</b> | 130",
      "<b>OSPF External</b> | 150",
      "<b>IS-IS Level 1 External</b> | 160",
      "<b>IS-IS Level 2 External</b> | 165",
      "<b>BGP</b> | 170",
      "<b>MSDP</b> | 175",
  ],
) }}
