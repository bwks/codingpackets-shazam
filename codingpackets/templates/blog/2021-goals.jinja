<h4>Health and Fitness</h4>
<p>
  This year I will continue the healthy lifestyle and
  I am setting myself some ambitous targets. 
</p>
<p>
  The goal is to be jacked and shredded AF at 8% body fat. 
  My core targets to achieve that goal are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>1000 pushups a week</li>
  <li>1000 burpies a week</li>
  <li>1000 chinups a week</li>
  <li>1000 kettle bell swings a week</li>
  <li>200 rollouts a week</li>
</ul>
<p>
  My cycling goal for the year is 
  300+ FTP and 200+ kms a week.
</p>
<p>
  I am also entering a half iron man in March.
  Good times.
</p>

<h4>Family</h4>
<p>
  Family time is going to be a huge focus again this year. 
  Although im unable to make any plans at the moment due to 
  covid I am hoping to get away a couple of times with the 
  kids. Last year I had a great time with my kids at every 
  opportunity and that will coninute this year.
</p>

<h4>Certifications</h4>
<p>
  Forget the OX, this year is the year of the certification. 
</p>

<h5>PCNSE</h5>
<p>
  I am starting a new job in late January and as part of that 
  role I need to get certed up Palo Alto products. Getting 
  to the PCNSE 10 is first on the list.
</p>

<h5>AWS Solution Architect Associate</h5>
<p>
  I have been using AWS a fair bit over the last year and 
  AWS skills are more and more in demand. This one is 
  next on the list.
</p>

<h5>CCNP SP</h5>
<p>
  All of my Cisco certs have expired. I have been doing a 
  bit of SP work over the last couple of years, mostly with 
  Juniper tech and Cisco is an important player in this part 
  of the network space. The CCNP SP is the first step on 
  route to the CCIE SP
</p>

<h5>JNCIP SP</h5>
<p>
  Alot of the theory around service provider routing and 
  switching is transferable between Cisco and Juniper certs. 
  While studying for the CCNP SP I will in parallel, 
  study for the JNCIP SP. I will do this by completing 
  labs with both Cisco and Junper routers/switches and 
  filling in the vendor specific theory gaps where needed.
</p>

<h4>Books</h4>
<p>
  I will continue my goal of reading / listening to 20 
  non-technical books in 2021. I have a pile of physical 
  books that need reading and ALOT of audible books to get 
  through.
</p>

<h4>Automation</h4>
<p>
  I have been working on a secret network automation project.
  At some point this year, I plan to release it to the 
  world.
</p>

<h4>Mansformation</h4>
<p>
  I have been going through a process of growing my hair and
  {{ link::i(path="/blog/growing-a-beard", description="growing a beard") }}
  since May 2020. That process will continue in 2021 until I 
  reach Jason Mamoa level of Manliness. 
</p>


<h3 id="outro">Outro</h3>

  open though, kick them off the hinges.
