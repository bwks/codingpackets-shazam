<p>
  There are a number of methods to define variables in Go.
</p>

{{ text::code_block(
  header="go",
  language="go",
  code='// Initialise variable with its zero value
// explicitly defining the variables type
var stuff string
// Assign a value to "stuff" variable
stuff = "stuff"

// Initialise variable and assign a value
var stuff string = "stuff"

// Shortcut method to initialise variable and assign a value
// The type will be inferred from the value
// This method can only be used inside a function
stuff := "stuff"

// Declare multiple variables on a single line
var stuff, things string = "stuff", "things"

// Alternate method to declare multiple variables
var (
    stuff = "stuff"
    things = "things"
)

// Constants are variables were the value cannot be changed
const stuff string = "stuff"'
) }}

<h3 id="considerations">Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Variable names must begin with a letter or a number</li>
  <li>When a variable is declared but not yet assigned it has a default value for its type</li>
  <li>A variable that is declared must be used</li>
  <li>Constants can only be assigned at the package level</li>
</ul>
