<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>
  A project I am currently working on requires me to configure Cisco ACI. I have not previously
  had the opportunity to work with ACI and I had no access to a lab environment to prove
  out my changes before implementing them into production. A while ago a heard about a service
  Cisco is offering called {{ link::e(path="https://dcloud.cisco.com/", description="dCloud") }} that allows you to
  spin up resources free of charge for testing, training and demoing purposes. I had a poke
  around and they have a couple of ACI labs that looked promising so I decided to give it
  a whirl.
</p>

<p>
  This post will cover using the OpenConnect VPN client to connect to a Cisco dCloud
  lab environment. For reference the following software was used in this post.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Ubuntu</b> - 1804</li>
  <li><b>OpenConnect</b> - v7.08-3</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pre-flight check">Pre-flight Check</h3>
<p>
  At the time of writing, the only pre-requisite to use the dCloud labs is a CCO account,
  you don't require a support contract.
</p>

<p>
  The dCloud labs can be accessed over a HTML5 web browser, this works kind of OK but its
  not ideal. There is also the option to access the LAB via the Cisco Anyconnect VPN client
  but I did not want to install it just to access the dCloud labs. I am using Linux Ubuntu
  and there is an alternative VPN client that I use which is compatible with multiple VPN
  concentrators called {{ text::emphasize(text="OpenConnect") }}
.
</p>

<h4><b>OpenConnect Installation</b></h4>
<p>
  Installation is pretty straight forward using the {{ text::code(text="apt") }}
 package management
  utility.
</p>
{{ text::code_block(
  header="cmd",
  language="text",
  code=`sudo apt install -y network-manager-openconnect`
) }}

<p>
  Once installed a VPN session can be initiated with the {{ text::code(text="openconnect") }}
 command.
</p>

{{ text::note_block(text='
    sudo/root privileges are required to activate a VPN connection.
') }}

<h3 id="lab-access">Lab Access</h3>

<p>
  Once you have scheduled a lab and the start time for the lab has begun you will be able to
  get the VPN details for the lab. First select the session you would like to connect to.
</p>

{{ image::boxed(path="blog/cisco-dcloud-access-from-linux-host/sessions.png", width="900px") }}

<p>
  Then from the info link you can access the VPN details. Below you can see the VPN host is
  {{ text::emphasize(text="dcloud-sng-anyconnect.cisco.com") }}
 and the username | password
  is {{ text::emphasize(text="v308user1") }}
 | {{ text::emphasize(text="643d7b") }}
.
</p>

{{ image::boxed(path="blog/cisco-dcloud-access-from-linux-host/session-info.png", width="900px") }}

<p>
  Once you have the VPN details from the dCloud lab info section use the host as the VPN
  endpoint parameter for OpenConnect and enter the username | password when prompted.

<p>
  Once you are connected routes for the lab network are installed in your routing table so
  you can browse to any web endpoints, remote desktop to the Windows10 VM or ssh to the hosts
  in the lab using the local tools installed on your machine.
</p>

{{ text::code_block(
  header="cmd",
  language="text",
  code=`ip route show

) }}

  This is great because you can use the tools you are familiar with and likely use in your
  day to day travels. This is especially helpful if you are using or developing tools to
  automate Cisco products and don't have physical and or virtual devices to test against.
</p>

<p>
  Cisco dCloud looks like a pretty useful platform for testing/trailing Cisco products, it
  could also be pretty helpful for testing automation tools if you don't have access to
  dedicated resources. Using a VPN client like {{ text::emphasize(text="OpenConnect") }}

  means you can access the dCloud labs using the tools you are familiar with. Kudos to Cisco
  for offering this service and making it free of charge.
