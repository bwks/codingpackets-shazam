<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>
  Recently, I had to replace one of the nodes in my 
  3 node Proxmox cluster. Once I replaced it, I found 
  that I had certificate (both HTTP and SSH) errors between 
  the hosts
</p>
<p>
  In this post, I will show you how to resolve that issue.
</p>

{{ text::important_block(text='
   I found the solution to these problems on the excellent 
   Proxmox forum. I did however, lose the links to the posts.
   All credit goes to the legends of the forum who will be 
   forever unkown. I apologise for not being able to accurately 
   link to those references.
') }}

<p>
  The following software was used in this post.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Proxmox</b> - 7.1-8</li>
</ul>

{{ text::note_block(text='
   The following commands should be executed on 
   all PVE nodes. 
') }}

<h3 id="https-certificates">HTTPS Certificates</h3>
<p>
  HTTPS certificates are used to enable secure 
  communication between the PVE nodes via the web 
  interface.
</p>
<p>
  Delete the HTTPS certificates.
</p>
{{ text::code_block(
  header="cmd",
  language="text",
  code='rm /etc/pve/pve-root-ca.pem
rm /etc/pve/priv/pve-root-ca.key
rm /etc/pve/nodes/pmx01/pve-ssl.pem
rm /etc/pve/nodes/pmx02/pve-ssl.pem
rm /etc/pve/nodes/pmx03/pve-ssl.pem
rm /etc/pve/nodes/pmx01/pve-ssl.key
rm /etc/pve/nodes/pmx02/pve-ssl.key
rm /etc/pve/nodes/pmx03/pve-ssl.key
rm /etc/pve/authkey.pub
rm /etc/pve/priv/authkey.key
rm /etc/pve/priv/authorized_keys'
) }}

<p>
  Generate new HTTPS certificates
</p>
{{ text::code_block(
  header="cmd",
  language="text",
  code='pvecm updatecerts -f'
) }}

<p>
  Restart the 
  {{ text::emphasize(text="pvedaemon") }}

  and 
  {{ text::emphasize(text="pveproxy") }}

  services.
</p>
{{ text::code_block(
  header="cmd",
  language="text",
  code='systemctl restart pvedaemon pveproxy'
) }}

<h4>SSH Certificates</h4>
<p>
  SSH is used to migrate VM's between nodes.
</p>
<p>
  Move the ssh 
  {{ text::emphasize(text="known_hosts") }}
 file. 
</p>

{{ text::code_block(
  header="cmd",
  language="text",
  code='mv /root/.ssh/known_hosts /root/.ssh/known_hosts_old'
) }}

<p>
  Now SSH between all the nodes to ensure you have no 
  SSH issues.
</p>

<h4>Reboot</h4>
<p>
  Finally, shutdown the VM's and reboot the hosts, one 
  by one.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, refresh the web browser page you use to 
  connect to the PVE cluster and accept the new certificate.
</p>

  In this post, I showed you how to resolve both 
  the HTTPS and SSH certificate issues on a Proxmox cluster 
  if you replace one of the nodes.
