<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>
  One of my goals for 2022 was to obtain some cloud based 
  certifications that align more with my current career goals. 
  I started out with the AWS Solutions Architect 
  Associate exam (SAA-C02). TL/DR, I passed!
</p>
<p>
  In this post, I will cover the process and tools that I used 
  to obtain the certification.
</p>

<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
<p>
  I have been using AWS cloud off and on for about 6 years. Mostly 
  for building demos for work related tasks. I also host this blog 
  on AWS, so I had a bit of a handle on some of the more common services. 
  (IAM, EC2, S3, Route 53, CloudFront, etc..)
</p>
<p>
  So what did I use the study for this certification? Let's dig in!
</p>

<h4>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C02 & SAA-C03) by Adrian Cantrill</h4>

  This

) }}
  is very in-depth, it not only covers the exam topics but 
  also helps you to understand and build AWS infrastructure for real-world 
  enterprise environments. 
</p>
<p>
  Adrian does some of the best diagrams I have ever seen. 
  IMO, they look extremely slick and have just the right 
  amount of information.
</p>
<p>
  The course can be purchased to own without a subscription and it is 
  very reasonibly priced related to the quality of the content.
</p>

<h4>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C02) by A Cloud Guru (Ryan Kroonenburg and Alex Galvin) </h4>
<p>
  This
  {{ link::e(
    path="https://acloudguru.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02", 
    description="course"
) }}
  is more focused on giving you what you need to pass the exam.
  It was a great course to use as a refresher after I went through 
  Adrian Cantrill's course.
</p>
<p>
  One of the best thing about this course is the access to cloud labs. 
  If you don't want to use your own AWS account, you can use the ACG 
  labs for the labbing components.
</p>
<p>
  A Cloud Guru is a subscripiton based service, so you either need to
  sign up for a Yearly or Monthly subscription to access the content.
</p>

<h3 id="labs">Labs</h3>
<p>
  Labbing is pretty imporant for me to solidify what I am learning 
  through video/book/blog content. I went through most of the labs 
  in both courses. I skipped the ones that I felt that I already 
  had a pretty good handle on based on my existing experience.
</p>

<h3 id="practice-exams">Practice Exams</h3>
<p>
  To get a feel of the questions in the exam I used the 
  {{ link::e(
    path="https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-exams/", 
    description="Totorials Dojo"
) }} practice tests. This is a really helpful study aid, where you 
  go through mock exams with similar questions and answers to what 
  you will find in the exam. It also helped me get into the required 
  timing rhythm to get through all the questions in time on the actual 
  exam.
</p>
<p>
  I first went through the {{ text::emphasize(text="Topic Based") }}
 
  and then the {{ text::emphasize(text="Review Mode") }}
 questions. 
  I was getting around 70% in the mock exams prior to taking the actual exam.
  My exam date came up, so I didn't get to go through them all but if I 
  had more time, I would have also gone through the 
  {{ text::emphasize(text="Section Based") }}
 and 
  {{ text::emphasize(text="Timed Mode") }}
 exams.
</p>
<p>
  The thing I liked best about these practice tests, is they don't just 
  tell you <b>WHAT</b> the correct answer is, they also tell you <b>WHY</b> it's the 
  correct answer. Additionally, they also tell you <b>WHY</b> the other answers 
  are incorrect. For me, this was really key in helping me understand what 
  services are most suitable for a given scenario.
</p>
<p>
  These practice tests are buy to own and are very reasonibly priced.

<h3 id="time-budget">Time Budget</h3>
<p>
  All up I spent about 3 months studying for the exam. I spent around 1-3 
  hours a day for the majority and 3-5 hours a day in the last couple 
  of weeks leading up to the exam.
</p>

<h3 id="study-notes">Study Notes</h3>
<p>
  I took notes as I was studying, but I did not have time to convert them 
  into posts here. As I move through my next set of course on the way 
  to the Solutions Architect Professional exam I will add more of my study 
  notes as posts on this site.
</p>

<h3 id="the-result">The Result</h3>
<p>
  I passed the exam with a score of 804 / 1000 ðŸ¥³ The pass mark was 720.
</p>

<h3 id="the-verdict">The Verdict</h3>
<p>
  All in all, the exam is a pretty fair representation of what you can 
  probably be expected to know as an AWS Solution Architect. Half the battle 
  is knowing the AWS services (there is ALOT) and how they tie together 
  for a given scenario.
</p>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<p>
  Here are a couple of tips that could help future Brad and maybe you too.
</p>
<h4>Know the AWS Services</h4>
<p>
  Not just the ones are covered in the training material. ALL OF THEM!
  Just knowing that: <i><b>Amazon Comprehend Medical</b></i> &nbsp; IS actually a REAL service
  (not just some made up bullshit to confuse you) that 
  uses machine learning to extract insights and relationships from medical text.
  Can help you rule out incorrect answers quickly in the exam.
</p>
<p>
  It's a big ask, since there are ALOT of AWS services, and the list is growing 
  all the time, but I think this will be helpful for real-life and the exam. You don't 
  have to know the ins-and-outs, just the highlights.
</p>

<h4>Global vs Regional Services</h4>
<p>
  Knowing this can help to quickly rule out incorrect answers. 
</p>

<h4>Practice, Practice Practice</h4>
<p>
  Build labs based on AWS validated designs. This helps you to understand which 
  services go well together in the eyes of AWS. 
</p>
<p>
  Use the practice tests, they are a lot cheaper than doing the exam multiple 
  times and helped me identify the weak areas that I needed to focus more on.
</p>

<h4>Don't Dwell on Questions in the Exam</h4>
<p>
  You might not know the answer. Pick one that sounds right 
  and flag it for review. Unlike some exams, you can go back at the end if 
  you have time. I had ~10 questions flagged for review and I changed 
  my answer on about 3 of them.
</p>

<h4>Design Considerations</h4>
<p>
  When reading through the questions check for the relevant keywords.
  Does the situation call for a Highly Available, Durable, Scalable, 
  Cost-Effective, Highly Secure and or Time Sensitive solution? Knowing which 
  services map to these attributes really helps to narrow down the correct 
  answer. 
</p>

<h3 id="outro">Outro</h3>
<p>
  I am pretty stoked to get this one over the line. I have had it on my 
  radar for a few years. And now, on to the next one!
