<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>
  I recently purchased Narbiks CCIE routing and switching v5.1 workbook bundle.
  Some of the labs in the workbook use devices with serial interfaces. I run most
  of my lab in Vagrant/KVM/Qemu. Qemu does not support serial interfaces and I
  dont have any physical devices any more. Shit! What now?

<h3 id="emulators-emulators-emulators">Emulators, Emulators, Emulators</h3>
<p>
  After searching around, both GNS3 and EVE-NG looked promising. I have not used GNS3
  for years and support for devices with serial interfaces is mostly supported using
  the Dynamips emulator. I didnt want to go down that route unless really necessary.
  The workbook was written to be compatible with EVE-NG and IOL images looks to be
  well supported. There is a bit of messing around with licensing to get it working
  and its probably legally pretty shaky so I didnt want to use that either.
  In another life I worked at a $NETWORK_VENDOR and long story short I had an old WEB-IOL
  VM that I had held on to. I fired it up and after 7 years in cold storage what do
  you know. It worked!

  The below NETMAP file is used to build the topology for the workbook.

<p>
  IOL is a bit of an ancient monster. It was (maybe still is) used internally
  at $NETWORK_VENDOR so there is very little documentation out in the wild for
  it. Luckily I some how managed to remember how to drive it.
  There are pirate copies out there, but most of the world has moved onto
  GNS3/EVE-NG/VIRL etc... use one of those instead. Unless of course
  you are a tragic/weird/unhinged individual like me then knock yourself out.
