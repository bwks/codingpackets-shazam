  If you have Parallels use that to create a Windows 10 VM and use Windows
  Media Creator to create the bootable USB.

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>
  I recently built a PC that I intend to use for gaming and recording content on
  and I want to use Windows 10 as the operating system.
  I only had a Macbook and needed to create a bootable USB drive so
  I could install Windows. It's 2020 and you would think this would be easy.
  THINK AGAIN SAM!

  For the last few years {{ link::e(path="https://www.balena.io/etcher/", description="Etcher") }}
 has been
  my goto bootable USB making tool. It works on Windows/Mac/Linux and is great for creating
  bootable USB drives of many different variants. UNLESS! You want to create a bootable
  Windows USB. It does not create Bootable Windows USB's ... LE-SIGH !!!!

<h3 id="the-struggle-is-real">The Struggle Is Real</h3>
<p>
  After half a day of stuffing around with different disk formatting options and
  methods of getting the Windows files onto the USB I finally managed to create
  a bootable USB. Victory? Not quite!
</p>
<p>
  I won't bother going over the steps because once Windows booted to the installer
  I was getting an error along the lines of "A media driver is missing".
  There is a lot of conflicting information around what is the cause of the error.
  In the end I gave up on ever being able to create a bootable Windows 10 USB from
  MacOS.

  When I purchased my new Mac I switched over from VMWare's Fusion to the
  {{ link::e(path="https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/", description="Parallels") }}
 virtual
  machine software. It has a nifty feature to create a Windows 10 VM with 1 click.
  I used this to build a Windows 10 VM and create the bootable USB from within
  the VM with Windows Media Creator. Boring I know.
</p>

<h3 id="outro">Outro</h3>
<p>
  Creating a bootable Windows USB without a Windows PC/VM is a shit show.
  If you have parallels use that to create a Windows 10 VM and use Windows
  Media Creator to create the bootable USB.
