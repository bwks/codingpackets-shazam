<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>
  I recently moved onto my new house and I finally got the chance 
  to mount the wireless access points that I had in storage for 
  a couple of years. When I connected them, the Unifi controller 
  said they are managed by another controller. Since I last used these 
  access points, I had re-built the controller so this makes sense. 
</p>
<p>
  Getting the APs under management of the Unifi controller was frustraighting 
  and not very straight forward. This post covers the issues I enountered and 
  the eventual fix to get the APs managed.
</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>
  The following software was used in this post.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ubiquiti UAP-AC-Pro - 6.2.44</li>
  <li>Unifi Controller (VM) - 6.5.55</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="factory-reset">Factory Reset</h3>
<p>
  The first thing I tried was to factory reset the APs. When I did this 
  the APs connected, but I got the error that the {{ text::emphasize(text="Adoption Failed") }}.
  At this point, there was no way to remove the AP from the UI.
</p>

<h3 id="inform-url">Inform URL</h3>
<p>
  The {{ text::emphasize(text="Inform URL") }} is used to tell the controller 
  about the Access point. Alot of forum posts and aritcles pointed to manually 
  set this to restart the adoptiopn procees. The default inform URL is:
  {{ text::emphasize(text="http://unifi:8080/inform") }}. I SSH'd to the AP using 
  the default credentials {{ text::emphasize(text="ubnt/ubnt") }} and set the inform URL 
  with the {{ text::code(text="set-inform http://&lt;controller-ip&gt;:8080/inform") }}.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, this did not help and the AP was still stuck in the 
  {{ text::emphasize(text="Adoption Failed") }} state.
</p>

<h3 id="logs">Logs</h3>
<p>
  At this point, I started looking at the log files. The log on the APs is 
  located here: {{ text::emphasize(text="/var/log/messages") }}. The log 
  had some errors relating to the inform process failing. 
</p>

{{ text::code_block(
  header="log",
  language="text",
  code=`Fri Dec  9 11:11:50 2022 daemon.err mcad: mcad[1235]: ace_reporter.reporter_fail(): Server Reject (http://&lt;controller-ip&gt;:8080/inform)`
) }}

<p>
  On the controller, the logs are located here:
  {{ text::emphasize(text="/var/log/unifi/server.log") }}. I found numerous 
  errors relating to AP adoption.
</p>

{{ text::code_block(
  header="log",
  language="text",
  code=`[2022-12-09T21:17:36,471] &lt;inform-2&gt; WARN inform - dev[78:8a:20:80:2b:e6] used default key in ADOPT_FAILED state, reject it!
[2022-12-09T22:09:47,258] Detected duplicated uap[78:8a:20:80:2b:e6] while fetching site and pending adoption devices
[2022-12-09T22:09:47,258] &lt;ubnt/tcp4&gt; ERROR dev - SSH adopt failed adopt_state[2],prev_state[2],firmware[6.2.44.14098],model[U7PG2],uses_default_credentials[false]`
) }}

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>
  The solution to this problem involves a few steps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Connect to the Mongo DB database on the Unifi Controller.</li>
  <li>Delete the access points from the database.</li>
  <li>Restart the Unifi Controller.</li>
  <li>Factory Reset the Access Points.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  To connect to Mongo DB, I needed to install the {{ text::emphasize(text="mongodb-clients") }} 
  package.
</p>

{{ text::code_block(
  header="cmd",
  language="text",
  code=`sudo apt install -y mongodb-clients`
) }}

<p>
  Next, connect to Mongo DB and delete the offending AP's.
</p>

{{ text::code_block(
  header="cmd",
  language="text",
  code=`sudo mongo --port 27117
use ace
db.device.remove({"mac":"&lt;mac-address&gt;"});
exit`
) }}


<p>
  Finally, restart the controller and 
  {{ link::e(path="https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/205143490-UniFi-How-to-Reset-Devices-to-Factory-Defaults", description="factory reset the APs") }}. 
  The APs will be removed from the Unifi controller and you will be able 
  to start the adoption process again. Fingers crossed, this works, I had 
  to do this multiple times for some APs, but eventually, I get them all 
  connected again.
</p>


<h3 id="outro">Outro</h3>
<p>
  In this post, I covered the process to recover an Ubiquiti AP that is 
  stuck in the {{ text::emphasize(text="Adoption Failed") }} state. It 
  was a bit painful, but I got there in the end, if you faced the same issue 
  I did and found this post, I hope it helped you get to the solution faster 
  than I did ✌️
