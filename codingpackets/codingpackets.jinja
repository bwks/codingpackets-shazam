      Hey you ðŸ‘‹ thanks for visiting my little corner of the wild wild web ðŸ¤ 
      I'm Brad, a bag of meat and bones from Brisbane, Australia ðŸªƒ
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a background in networking, but somewhere along the way I learned
      how to code ðŸ¤¯
    </p>
    <p>
      At ${JOB} I work with customers as a solution architect in 
      the Network Detection and Response (NDR) field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here at {{ link::i(path="#", description="codingpackets.com") }},
      I write about my adventures in networking, security, cloud and devops 
      as I attempt to automate all the stuff and things! 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like to reach me, I can maybe, possibly be contacted 
      through the links in the footer down there ðŸ‘‡
