      Hey you ðŸ‘‹ thanks for visiting my little corner of the wild wild web ðŸ¤ .
      I'm Brad, a bag of meat and bones from Brisbane, Australia ðŸªƒ.
      I have a background in networking, but somewhere along the way I learned
      how to code ðŸ¤¯.
      At ${JOB} I work with customers as a solution architect in 
      the Network Detection and Response (NDR) field.
      Here at
      <a href="">codingpackets.com</a>,
      I write about my adventures in networking, security, cloud and devops 
      as I attempt to automate all the stuff and things! 
      If you would like to reach me, I can maybe, possibly be contacted 
      through the links in the footer down there ðŸ‘‡
    </p>
